# AttendanceBot
A Simple Discord Bot that prints out users that are currently in the voice channel

This bot was designed during the pandemic to help online educators using Discord and automate tasks such as taking attendance.

The bot itself detects the author of the "--attendance" command as a professor/host and prints out all members in the host's voice channel.
